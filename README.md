Playing cricket with TFlite and Ardiuno

Trained TFlite model detects whether person is hitting the ball or not. I am going to update it. And connect it with a web interface. So we can play cricket game with Ardiuno.
I am new to TinyML. Just learning all these things. It is awesome. I would like to thank whole TFlite for Microcontroller team. They are doing amazing work.
